 * NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System Support v2
 * The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides an open framework 
 * for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities. 
 * CVSS consists of 3 groups: Base, Temporal and Environmental. Each group 
 * produces a numeric score ranging from 0 to 10, and a Vector, a compressed 
 * textual representation that reflects the values used to derive the score. 
 * The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability. The 
 * Temporal group reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that change 
 * over time. The Environmental group represents the characteristics of a 
 * vulnerability that are unique to any user's environment. CVSS enables IT 
 * managers, vulnerability bulletin providers, security vendors, application 
 * vendors and researchers to all benefit by adopting this common language of 
 * scoring IT vulnerabilities.
