CVSS v2 Java Data Structure

NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System Support v2
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides an open framework 
for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities. 
CVSS consists of 3 groups: Base, Temporal and Environmental. Each group 
produces a numeric score ranging from 0 to 10, and a Vector, a compressed 
textual representation that reflects the values used to derive the score. 
The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability. The 
Temporal group reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that change 
over time. The Environmental group represents the characteristics of a 
vulnerability that are unique to any user's environment. CVSS enables IT 
managers, vulnerability bulletin providers, security vendors, application 
vendors and researchers to all benefit by adopting this common language of 
scoring IT vulnerabilities.
